=========================================

The language used is: Python

### 1- Asking the user to enter 2 positive integer and find the Multiplicative inverse of it, and if there is no multiplicative inverse it will show you the output.

### 2-  python 3.x (no matter the verion)

### 3- The user must enter 2 positive number (a) to find the multiplicative invers for and the modules (b), after the user enter these data, the program will module (a) % (b) and the output will be in terminal

### 4- Enter a number (a) to find its multiplicative inverse for: 3
   Enter a number (b) which is the modulos: 11

   The multiplicative inverse of 3 mod 11 is 4.
